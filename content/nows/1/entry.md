This is my first **now** entry, first let me talk about what I've been doing in the past 2 months:

* Rebuilt my personal site (this one is the new one)
* Apply to some companies
* Unclutter my desk and room
* Going paperless
* Get rid of all saved shit, I'm trying to overcome [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)

So, why I did those things? Well, in the first place, I just wanted to clear my mind in order to work in the things that matter, that is, ship products and market them, find a job and increase my income.

What I'm doing now is that, now that I cleared out the way to have a clear path to follow, it's time to start planning and developing, I'm taking action towards my goals, no more reading business books/articles/podcasts, from today to the end of the year I'm going to focus in action.

I'm going to share my results in January 2018.

Let's see how I roll.
