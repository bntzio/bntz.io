**In today’s world, we all need to move, to create, to fucking launch.**

In order to be successful, people need to move, and move fast, our world is at a very fast pace rate, there are millions of things to do, to master and to learn.

### The importance of building and launching

We all want to do things, we dream and have goals, projects, and ideas all over our heads, but… Do you actually launch them?

Here’s the problem.

Our world is moving very fast, and we need to be able to go faster (or at least at the same pace) because we live surrounded by things we must do, like work, eat, go there, fix that, and so on, but where are our goals, projects, and ideas? Well, that’s when you need a key factor to success, build, and launch.

In order to build and launch you need to make time for those big projects and ideas you got, make space and don’t overflow too much about unimportant things in your life, you need to prioritize.

If you want to achieve something is because you know you need it to be better, so that’s important, and you must find the time to work for it.

That is when it comes out another key factor you’ll need to build and launch, and to achieve your goals, time.

### Timeframes

A person can’t stay attached to an idea or goal too much, that’s poison, why? Because we need to do things we must do, and that’s inevitable, so there must be a workaround, there’s when the timeframes jump into action.

Timeframes provides you a sense of urgency, which is important if you want to see progress, let’s say, for example, you need to deliver a work in one month, I bet you’re going to say: “I’ll do it later, I got a lot of time, instead I’m going to do this other important thing”, well, that’s bad and good, you may prioritize your tasks, and that’s a good thing to do, but in the terms of your goals, ambitions and projects, you can’t prioritize that easy, because that must be your most important thing to do, that’s your ONE thing.

### Launch quick, and move fast

The importance of launching quick and move fast is easy to understand, you don’t want to focus your full attention to something for too long (well it depends in your goal), but instead, you need to launch quickly as possible, and the reason for it is that you don’t want to invest lots of your time by building something too complex or too big that at the end, no one will use (or at least not as much people as you expect).

You could sacrifice 100% of your time in one big idea or project you really want to do, that’s fine, as I said before, launching quick and move fast depends a lot in your goal, let’s say, you want to build a complex project, you could spend 1 year doing it, and when you ship it, you could get the results you were expecting, that’s excellent, but hard to achieve, because as you know, starting a startup is to enter to an unknown world, it’s uncertain, you won’t know what will happen, so before spending too much time on some project or idea, you got two options: a) use a framework to test viability (like the Lean Startup) and increase the chance of success, or b) build and ship fast, so if you fail you can throw away your project and move to another one, do a mini-pivot or, if you succeed, create another big thing, and so on, that’s the essence of launching quick and move fast, for makers, that’s a super important thing to do, to be able to build and move on to another project or idea, because as you know, makers do that, they make, ship and repeat.

### We need to challenge ourselves and push further

There’s a very good strategy to achieve big results in a relatively short amount of time, I learned this from [levels.io](undefined) (which I admire a lot, by the way) in his blog post [12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) he challenged himself to build 12 startups in 12 months, in that way, he pushed himself and maximized the output.

You can as well set a goal like this and achieve great results, you are going to work a lot, though, because you need to focus on your goals to finally get your results, in the specified timeframe.

As Pieter Levels did, I’m going to set a challenge for myself in a couple of days, and you should too. Specify the goal or project, that’s the X, and a timeframe, the Y, and fucking do it, that’s the only way to achieve something, by working for it, so go out and make something awesome, become a better you, focus on what’s important and what will make you better, create your own X in Y challenges.

And remember, be authentic, create something big, get shit done and be a fucking rockstar.
