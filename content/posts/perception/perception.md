We think we’re right until we get real.

Almost one year ago I was building my very first web app, it was called Phoenix, and I was really emotionally and passionately optimistic about that product, I kept saying everyone that Phoenix will be a big hit, that it’s going to be a real big startup, and that I knew how to do it right. I launched it half a year later and nobody gave a fuck about it.

It has been an incredible journey in a short year, my perception about building and launching products changed so radically I’m so impressed, now I realize that a lot of the thoughts we have may not be the right ones in many occasions, we tend to think that we know how to do the things the best way, but it just isn’t true, we don’t know until we ship stuff out in the real world.

I learned a lot from that product launch, too much I won’t tell it now but in another time, the story I want to tell you now is that the only way to really learn business and marketing is by making and shipping real stuff, that’s how we hone those skills, we don’t learn business in classroom, we learn and understand the whole biz dev ecosystem out there in the real world, you need to get out and get real.

Back in the days of my first product launch, I thought I knew everything, from marketing to biz dev skills, I was 100% sure my product was going to be a huge hit, I read business articles and marketing books, took courses and well, the reality is that you don’t really know anything until you ship.

The real story was that nobody cared about my product, I spent almost half a year coding 15 straight hours a day, perfecting my product, doing design iterations, adding more and more features, incrementing the complexity of my product, I bought an expensive server and a looked for the perfect domain, I worried about the legal stuff, got a new business bank account, hired a lawyer, hell I even wanted to register my business name, I hired a designer to make my logo, I bought an ssl certificate, I bought some custom icons, I used the most expensive transactional email service, I bought custom email addresses like *hello@tryphoenix.co* and *support@tryphoenix.co* well, you can imagine.

I did a ton of unnecessary things at the beginning, things that I thought I was 100% sure I needed, until I shipped the product and nobody cared, I got around 30 signups and $0 in profit, I just wasted time and money building it, the only thing I’m proud of it were two things: 1) my coding abilities improved since the app was somewhat complex and 2) my perception around building products changed.

Now I know that the only way to really learn about building and launching products is get out and ship real stuff, there’s a 99.9% your product will fail if you’re just starting (yes hate me, it’s the truth) but once you start learning from your product launches, you will realize that each time you ship a product it teaches you something new.

After Phoenix I launched another 3 products, without making the same mistakes again, instead I failed on new things, and learn from the new mistakes, they all were little side-projects, but on each product I did things differently.

My second product got around 100 signups, a little project I made in a weekend with $0 cost and the free trial of Illustrator, called [GaryQuotes](http://garyquot.es), but it still has its flaws.

On each product launch I learn, and then apply what I learn in the next one, each time I ship a new product my perception changes, just try it, launch something, and you’ll soon realize you were wrong about what you thought you had in control.

It’s almost magical, by getting real you start thinking real, the only way we learn is by making things happen, by trial and error, so be careful at the beginning, your perception may deceive you, but you should figure that out by yourself.

Thanks for reading.
