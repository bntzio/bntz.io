Ok, yesterday I spent all my day writing study cases for my projects, I wrote the study case for [Gitsy](https://bntz.io/projects/gitsy), [HexCandy](https://bntz.io/projects/hexcandy) and [Phoenix](https://bntz.io/projects/phoenix) 🔥

The Phoenix one wasn't easy! It's a mega post! I highly recommend it 👍

Today I did a walk with my dog Kasper, I'm going to do a walk with him every morning or every night I don't know yet, but yeah maybe every night, it's more relaxing at night.

Also, I thought about a different approach to do my journal entries, from now on I won't be writing daily but weekly. Why? Because I think I can focus on getting things done in the week and in the weekend write about what I did, also it would be a better format because I can implement the **5-Bullet Friday** (read about it [here](https://bntz.io/journal/2)) and the **5 minute journal** and the **weekly goals** and the **weekly updates**, all in one entry! 🙌

Honestly, some days I don't do anything interesting so reading daily entries would be a waste of your time 😅

So that's going to be the new approach I'm going to take with my journal.

**Each Sunday** I will write about:

* What I did in the week (weekly updates)
* Weekly goals results
* New goals for the week
* 10 minute journal (instead of 5, because I'll do it weekly)
* 5-Bullet Sunday (yeah [Tim](https://tim.blog/) I copied you)

I'm going to start today by specifying my goals for this week, so by Sunday I'll have the results 😄

### Goals for this week
* Finish my personal site completely
* Learn GraphQL and Vue.js
* Launch Ready Set Hunt (a project I'm building 🙂)
* Launch MakerSprints (another project I'm making 😆)
* Walk with my dog at least 4 days in a row!

Those will be my 5 goals for this week.

On Sunday I'll share the results! 👊
