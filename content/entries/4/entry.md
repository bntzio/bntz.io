Hi there 👋 this past week was not an awesome week for me since I failed to accomplish all my goals! 🤦‍

### Goal stats 📊
* Finish my personal site completely ❎
* Learn GraphQL and Vue.js ❎
* Launch Ready Set Hunt ❎
* Launch MakerSprints ❎
* Walk with my dog at least 4 days in a row! ❎

So sad 😞

You may be wondering, why I didn't do my goals? Well, mainly because of one thing (I know, there should be no excuses) and that is coz I was working on a big freelance project, and I'm going to work on it the rest of this month.

Anyways, today's a new and fresh start and let's begin with the right foot 🙂

This last week I learned Python instead of Vue.js and GraphQL (I needed to do some Python programming for the freelance gig) so now I know Python 🐍 well, Python was my very first programming language to learn, but that was when I was a kid, I forgot all the syntax haha 😅 but I re-learned it this week 😎

I enjoyed learning Python, I think it's a beautiful language, I love the clarity, the readability, everything is so clean and aesthetically pleasant. Python teaches you how to write good code.

One thing I didn't like of Python were the methods like **'Hello'.startswith('H')** or **'World'.islower()** since I come from a strong Javascript background I tend to write the methods camel-case (likeThis) instead of plain-case (likethis) but overall I love Python 🖤 I felt like [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) (one of my idols) hacking a computer haha 😝

Well, now to the new goals!

### Goals for this week
* Finish my site (I promise!)
* Finish reading the book: [Trust me I'm Lying](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/1591846285)
* Walk with Kasper at least 3 times
* Make good advance in my freelance gig
* Launch Ready Set Hunt (a project I'm making)

**Note:** I won't be doing the 10 minute journal because I'm going to do an experiment instead, in the next weeks I'll write about it 😉

### 5-Bullet Sunday
* Thought I'm reflecting on
> This past few days I've been thinking a lot about how to document my life, as you may already know, I love transparency, and I want to give people an insight of my life, not because I'm a rockstar or a millionaire but because as a lot of you I'm just a person trying to find answers in life, and I thought it would be helpful if I document my journey from the beginning, people may find my notes about life helpful or inspiring in some years, maybe I achieve big goals or maybe I just stay the same, we never know, but a person writing his memoirs and telling how to live and what to do from start to finish is pure gold advice.

* What I'm listening to
> [Syntax.fm](http://syntax.fm/) is a podcast by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski) about web development in general, they talk about the latest and hot technologies from code editors and the command-line up to React, Javascript libraries and even productivity hacks. Syntax has become my favorite programming podcast.

* What I'm reading
> [Trust me I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/1591846285) a book by Ryan Holiday in which he tells and dissect how the media really works, and how easy is to control it. I am enjoying this book so much, it gives a very valuable insight on the media-business and Ryan tells you how to take advantage of the weak points of those organizations. Whether you are an entrepreneur, a marketer or none of those, you should read this book to learn how the media manipulates people, but most importantly, how to manipulate the media for them to manipulate the people for you.

* What I'm watching
> [Decentralizing Everything with Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin | Disrupt SF 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN5BaCzsbo) - Ethereum's creator Vitalik Buterin was only 19 years old when he created Ethereum, a decentralized way to create smart contracts by taking advantage of the cryptocurrencies blockchain, Vitalik explains what Ethereum is and how it aims to solve different problems in today's world.

* Quote I'm pondering
> “My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it… but love it.” - Friedrich Nietzsche

I've been reading about amor fati recently, amor fati means love of fate, it is the power of learning to love your fate, as Robert Greene says: “Stop wishing for something else to happen, for a different fate. That is to live a false life.”

It's a very powerful stoic meditation, to accept our fate and love it.

That's all for this week 👋
