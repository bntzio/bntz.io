Well, today I spent my day coding all day 👨‍💻 tweaking my site design and finally using my publishing system (the one I'm using now).

This is my first entry in my public journal, I hope someone find this interesting, I'll be writing (hopefully) every day from now on about what happens in my daily life, as well as posting interesting thoughts and so on.

Apart from coding and building this site, I read all my emails (finally!) haha, I had like 200 pinned emails, but inbox zero again! ✨ yay!

Mm... Another interesting thing that happened to me today was that I woke up in the morning (around 7:30 am) feeling very optimistic and enthusiastic in working on my next side projects! 😄

Some days ago I was working on the version 2 of [Spoil Your Enemies](https://spoilyourenemies.xyz) and I have to say, it's looking amazing. That being said, I can't wait to work on what's next 🙂

I'll keep this journal entries short but informative.

So that's all for today (really) I just spent all my day coding and drinking coffee ☕.

Until tomorrow! 👋
