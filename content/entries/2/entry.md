Whoa! I haven't published anything on my journal since my first entry! 😬 I know I know, I said I was going to write daily, but common, I'm just starting to improve my productivity and document my journey, it's hard to do, but yeah I accept it, I procrastinated (again) and I didn't write on my journal as promised 🙄

Let's get for the second round, today is Sunday! 😄

So a quick recap of what I did last week...

I got some freelance jobs so I was working on that stuff the past days, and so I didn't have the time to work on my personal site or to write on my blog/journal and so on.

Anyways, that was all I did last week, work on some freelance projects as well as hang-out with some friends in the weekend, we went to a club on Friday night and we spent a good night together 🍸

Well, today is Sunday and it's time to plan the week! 🙌

My goal for tomorrow is to really finish this site!

Hey, you know what? I'm going to start writing little sections everyday in my entries, things like **daily/weekly goals** to stay accountant and if something else apart from goals comes to my mind I'll write them down as well.

Ok, I just got another two ideas! 💡

The first one is a [5 minute journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal). Some months ago I was reading the book [Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788) and Tim mentioned he uses the 5 minute journal every day to reflect himself and get a clear perspective of what's going on with his life, along with other benefits...

Sooo, I'm going to implement that (hopefully by today) in my personal site.

The other thing I thought about was to add a special entry all Fridays containing information and links about cool things I find in the week, similar to what Tim Ferriss does as well in his newsletter (5-Bullet Friday) when he writes a super short entry about 5 things:

- **Purchase I'm enjoying**
- **What I'm listening to**
- **What I'm reading**
- **What I'm watching**
- **Quote I'm pondering**

As you may already guess, I'm a big fan of Tim and I think by applying one or two of his activities I can give a better and clearer perspective about my life.

I love transparency ❤️

That's all for today! 😄
