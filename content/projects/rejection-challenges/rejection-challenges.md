## What is Rejection Challenges? 🤔
Rejection Challenges was a series of challenges that people needed to do in order to overcome fear of rejection.

You entered your email and each day for 30 days you received a challenge in your inbox.

The challenges looked like:

* Go out and ask a stranger if you could use his cellphone to make a quick call
* Try to buy something that is not for sale
* The next time you go to a gas station, ask someone if you could fill their car gas tank
* Try to get a free hotel room for a night

## How I came with the idea? 💡
One day I took a [business course](https://appsumo.com/how-to-make-your-first-dollar/) by [Noah Kagan](https://twitter.com/noahkagan) and one of the challenges was to ask for one dollar to someone, just for you to see how easy it can be to earn your first dollar 💵

That exercise teached me that the same principle applies to any business, you just have to show up in front of people and ask if they want to buy your product!

Now, I got the idea of Rejection Challenges when I did another challenge of the course, to **ask for a 10% off when buying a coffee**.

I said, hah! That's easy! So I went to a local coffee shop.

I walked in to the coffee shop, telling myself this was going to be really easy, but as soon as the waiting line reached my turn, I started sweating… Yes, this was very difficult, I didn’t know how to ask the cashier for a discount, I was frozen for some seconds, then I asked:

**“Hou much for this coffee?”**

I paid the total amount and left.

As I was leaving the store, I felt bad, really bad, I started thinking that I was a looser, that I failed that simple challenge, then I realized it really wasn’t easy, it was hard, and I needed to do it, I couldn't give up like that.

I went to another coffee shop, preparing mentally while waiting my turn to pay... Oh god, my turn:

- **Cashier -** "Hello! What are you taking today?"
- **Me -** "A cappuccino please"
- **Cashier -** "Which size?"
- **Me -** "Tall, please"
- **Cashier -** "That'd be 50 pesos (about 3 dollars)"
- **Me -** "Hum, could I get a 10% off discount?"
- **Cashier -** "Why?" \*I was shaking in this moment 👋\*
- **Me -** "I don't know" \*😂\*
- **Cashier -** "You don't have enough money, right?"
- **Me -** "No, I have! I just want a discount"
- **Cashier -** "Sorry, I can't do that!"
- **Me -** "That's ok, here you have, 50"

Yeah! I did it! I walked out the shop, smiling, feeling really, really good 😃

Why so excited and happy? You ask? I know, I didn’t get the discount, but I felt really good not because of that, but because nothing bad happened, just a raw “no”, a simple rejection, nothing more, nothing less.

That's when I discovered the power of overcoming fear of rejection.

### Why I built it? 🙂
I wanted to do more challenges like this one, so I started to invent interesting ones and searching in the Internet for other ones, then I found about [Rejection Therapy](https://www.rejectiontherapy.com/), a real life game made for anyone who wants to build confidence and overcome fear of rejection.

Then I decided to build something similar, and I called it [Rejection Challenges](https://github.com/bntzio/rejection-challenges).

Rejection Challenges was a free site (now an open source repository) that gave you daily challenges for you to take 😄

I really wanted the people to feel how I felt that day, I felt like if nothing were impossible, I felt the owner of my own destiny and life, it's really impressive, you should try it at least one time.

### How I built it? 👨‍💻
Rejection Challenges was perhaps the simplest side-project I've ever made, it was just a static site with a [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) form to send the [drip email campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_marketing) ✉️

Just HTML/CSS and an email form.

I used [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html) to get it done quickly, and also to learn how to use it because at that time I only knew how to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### What was the build process? ⚒️
I started to write the email sequences in ConvertKit, I had like 25 emails with one challenge each one.

The site looked like this:

### How long does it took to make? 📆
3 days 😄

### How much did it cost to build? 💸
Just the [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) ($29 USD/month) and the [fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/) ($10 USD/month) subscriptions, but since I used to use them for my newsletter and sites fonts I was paying for them anyways, apart from that the *rejectionchalleg.es* domain ($17 USD/year) was the only extra expense.

### Was it hard to make? 🙈
Nope! It's just HTML and CSS 🙂 pretty easy!

### What was the business model? 💰
No business model, I built Rejection Challenges just to learn how to use Foundation and give something back to the community.

### What was the marketing plan? 📈
I launched Rejection Challenges in [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/rejection-challenges) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/5ak3ho/rejection_challenges/), from those two sites I got the majority of my subscribers from Reddit 👽 

In Reddit, I sent this message to a user ([Ciarancallam](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ciarancallam/)) who was a mod at the [r/howtonotgiveafuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/) subreddit, so I asked for his help, and I helped him as well, win-win.

### What were the results? 😬
Around 50-80 people only, some weeks ago I deleted my ConvertKit ✉️ account and moved back to Mailchimp 🙊 because of the Free-Tier (ConvertKit doesn't have a free trial option) so I lost those subscribers, but that's cool since I didn't have a lot of signups.

### What did I learn? 🙌
It's ok to make non-profit projects and build stuff to learn something, but if you're going to make it for free and expect zero in profit, either make the project open source or go for the free alternative, in my case, I was paying $29 USD per month to keep the email sequences going plus the *.es* domain who was $17 USD per year. It was fun to make, but go for the free option instead, there are a lot of options.

* [Surge](https://surge.sh/) to host a static site for free
* [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) has free and premium plans (deployments)
* [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for emails offers a free-tier (0-1k subscribers)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) has a lot of free fonts to use
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is free as well (static site hosting)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) has a free option too (static site hosting)

And for domains, just choose a cheap one (.xyz) 👍

### What now? 😄
I recently made Rejection Challenges an Open Source project! 🙌

What that means is that now people can collaborate by adding more challenges into the list! 😄
