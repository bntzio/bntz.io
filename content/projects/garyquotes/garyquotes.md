## What is GaryQuotes? 🤔
GaryQuotes was an app to download cool iPhone wallpapers containing motivational [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://garyvaynerchuk.com) quotes.

## How I came with the idea? 💡
I made this some time ago while I was watching a lot of Gary Vaynerchuk videos on YouTube 📺

I have to say I was very motivated, the hustle, the hard work mode, everything Gary was saying in his videos were pure motivational food for me 😎

I become so obessed that I started to annotate all his phrases and quotes, things like: "Hustle 24/7", "Chase your dreams", "Work fucking hard", "Love the game", "Tell your story", and well I had all those quotes in my Notes app for me to remember those things in my daily life.

One day I thought, why not putting those phrases as my iPhone wallpaper? That way every time I stare at my phone (which I do all day haha) I'm going to feel the pump again and I won't forget what Gary says about working hard every day at every moment 👊

### Why I built it? 🙂
Primarily I built it because of two things, the first one was that I simply wanted to share it with the World 🌎 and the second one coz I wanted to learn React ⚛️

### How I built it? 👨‍💻
The site was very simple, I made it in plain [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) with an [Express](https://expressjs.com) server to serve the wallpapers as static assets.

Then I hosted it on [Surge](https://surge.sh) 🌐

And yes, I designed the wallpapers myself, with the [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) trial 👨‍🎨

### What was the build process? ⚒️
I began sketching a simple mockup on paper ✍️ and the final product was this one:

### How long does it took to make? 📆
I finished everything in one weekend ✨

### How much did it cost to build? 💸
Just the domain, garyquot.es which costed me about $17 USD 🙂

### Was it hard to make? 🙈
Super easy! It's just a static website 😉

Honestly, the hard part was to create the designs! I'm not a very good designer (yet) but the wallpapers were very simple to make, just a cool font with a nice background and voila 🙌

### What was the business model? 💰
Well, that's something I didn't plan for the long-term, but I just wanted to learn how to create a very basic React application, so I made it as an experiment, not for profit.

I did place a small box that said: "Advertise here", hoping someone was going to be interested in advertising something, but no one did! 🤦‍

Anyway that wasn't the real goal 😅

### What was the marketing plan? 📈
I launched GaryQuotes on [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) 😸 and I got into the top 10 product of that day (can't remember which place exactly, I think 6th place) with 200+ votes, so I got a lot of visitors! 😃

Apart from Product Hunt, that was all I did to market the product, nothing more.

### What were the results? 😬
Well, I did get lots of visitors and downloads, that's all 🙂 Nothing to measure really, as I didn't have any plans to monetize the product.

### What did I learn? 🙌
I did learn the very basics of React, that was my only goal.

Also, I learned that you can make and ship a product fast! This project took me one weekend to build and it got 200+ votes on Product Hunt, before GaryQuotes I launched another product called [Phoenix](https://bntz.io/projects/phoenix) and it did very bad, that one I built it in 6 months.

So it's better to launch fast and don't be too perfectionist on your product, make it on the hands of the people as fast as possible to validate your idea, and if it goes well, then add more features and shape the product as you go, you'll need to see how people respond to your product, and based on that feedback, make modifications to your project.

### What now? 😄
At the time of this writing, I moved the project into a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bntzio/garyquotes) for people who contribute on adding more wallpapers, improve the existing ones, modify them or do whatever the people want with them. I wasn't going to spend $17 USD again for a product with no revenue.

Also, I think it's a better idea, now it's an open source project 🙂

Feel free to contribute! 🎉
